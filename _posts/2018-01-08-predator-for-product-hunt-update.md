In this update my main focus was to automate the publishing part, i.e., uploading the apk automatically on google play using continous integration. With the help of automated publishing, publishing APKs over google play becomes very easy and saves a lot of time. I also created a blog series on how to automate google play publishing, [you can find it here]({% post_url 2017-12-26-automating-google-play-publishing-part1 %}).
